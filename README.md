# KWANCORE

The kwancore project is an extensive template for discord.py bots. 

## Prerequisites

## Selfhosting
If you're here, you probably know how to host a discord bot already :)

## Notices

This template has been made for RaspberryPis, and has the highest possibility of NOT breaking on Raspbian. It will probably run fine on any Debian-based distro too, but I wouldn't recommend running this on Windows, since some commands do require a bash terminal.

The whole entirety of this project is under GNU General Public License v3. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
