# KWANCORE

The kwancore project is an extensive template for discord.py bots. 

## Prerequisites

## Selfhosting
If you're here, you probably know how to host a discord bot already :)

## Notices

This template has been made for RaspberryPis, and has the highest possibility of NOT breaking on Raspbian. It will probably run fine on any Debian-based distro too, but I wouldn't recommend running this on Windows, since some commands do require a bash terminal.

The whole entirety of this project is under [GNU General Public License v3](LICENSE), except any libraries/modules that state otherwise (like the [shortcuts](bot/shortcuts) module, as it is under the [MIT License](bot/shortcuts).

## Legal Notices

This project uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) made by Rapptz, which is licensed under the MIT License. A copy of this can be found in [discord-py_license](licenses/discord-py_license).
